            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sagar Maiti, a first-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student. I’m more comfortable engaging with fewer people and enjoy spending time with those I already know. I love having meaningful conversations with familiar faces, as it helps me connect better. Although I prefer smaller social circles, I am passionate about technology and excited about learning new things in CSE.</p>

        <section id="education">
            <h2>Educational Background</h2>
            <p>I completed my 10th class in 2022 with 80.57% marks and my +2 class with 78%, both from the same rural school. I’m glad to share that I stayed at the same school for both degrees, which gave me a sense of continuity and comfort. Looking back, I’d say I was an average student, but I always tried my best to make the most of my learning experience.

        <section id="publications">
            <h2>Paper/Patent Publications</h2>
            <p>I’m still in the early stages of my journey in Computer Science and Engineering and haven’t had the chance to publish any papers or file patents yet. However, I’m actively learning and hope to contribute to research or innovative projects soon. While I may not have technical experience right now, I’m focused on building my skills and aim to integrate what I learn into my college work. My background in school has taught me the importance of hard work, and I’m excited about the opportunities ahead.</p>

        <section id="awards">
            <h2>Awards and Achievements</h2>
            <p>While I haven’t achieved any major awards in the technical field yet, I did receive recognition in school for my performance in specific subjects. I was awarded for scoring well in a few subjects, which was a proud moment for me during my academic journey. Though I consider myself an average student, these recognitions have motivated me to keep striving for excellence. As I continue to grow and learn in college, I look forward to achieving more and building on these early accomplishments.</p>

        <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>In school, I worked on projects in subjects like Chemistry and Physics, which helped me build problem-solving and research skills. I explored chemical reactions and motion, which now benefit me as I begin my Computer Science studies. Currently, I’m excited to be working on a technical project, marking my first foray into this area. Although I haven’t done any programming projects before, I’m eager to learn and apply my skills in this project and future endeavors. While I don’t have any patents or publications yet, I’m focused on building a strong foundation for future achievements.</p>
